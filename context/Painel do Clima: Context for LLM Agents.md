# Painel do Clima: Context for LLM Agents

## 1. Project Overview

Painel do Clima, powered by A Economia B, is a digital tool designed to translate Brazil’s public climate data into accessible, localized content. Its primary objective is to foster a "climate culture, one city at a time" across Brazil's 5,568 municipalities. The project addresses a critical gap between sophisticated climate science platforms and their effective communication and utilization by various stakeholders, including decision-makers, local newsrooms, and the general public.

### 1.1. Core Problem Addressed

The fundamental challenge Painel do Clima seeks to overcome is the disconnect between advanced climate science data, such as that provided by AdaptaBrasil, and its practical application and understanding at the local level. While platforms like AdaptaBrasil possess immense potential insight, this information often fails to reach key audiences, leading to several issues:

*   **Low Public Engagement:** Climate change often feels abstract to the general public, who primarily encounter it through disaster headlines, leading to limited personal engagement.
*   **Under-resourced Local Newsrooms:** Local news outlets frequently lack the necessary tools and context to effectively report on climate-related issues, missing opportunities to educate and mobilize communities.
*   **Policy Gaps:** Politicians and public servants often lack clear, localized data to guide climate adaptation and mitigation efforts, resulting in policies that are not 


climate-first. This creates a significant "bridge between science and communication," resulting in "urgency lost, resilience delayed" [4, 5]. Painel do Clima aims to bridge this gap [3, 4].

## 2. Objectives and Solutions

Painel do Clima's core solution involves transforming complex climate science data, primarily sourced from AdaptaBrasil, into content that is "local, relevant, and continuous" for every Brazilian city [3, 4, 6]. The project aims to integrate its tool into the daily operations of local newsrooms, city halls, and municipal chambers [3, 4, 7].

Painel do Clima achieves its objectives by serving as:

*   **A Cutting-Edge Climate Coverage Service for Newsrooms:** It provides tailored content and context, enabling newsrooms to effectively report on climate stories [3, 7].
*   **A Public Utility Tool for Citizens:** It simplifies complex climate topics through "accessible language," "visual dashboards, editorial curation and AI-powered storytelling" [3, 7]. This includes practical information on local impacts ("What will happen to our city?") and actionable preparation tips ("How can we prepare?") [3, 7].
*   **A Data-Driven Management Resource for Public Servants:** It guides climate adaptation laws and public policies by "bridging science, storytelling and governance" for mayors, councillors, and civil servants [3, 4, 7].

The ultimate goal is to establish Painel do Clima as a trusted resource that informs and inspires climate adaptation laws and public policies across Brazil [4].

## 3. Data Foundation and Synergy with AdaptaBrasil

Painel do Clima's primary data source is the AdaptaBrasil platform [1, 6]. AdaptaBrasil is recognized as a "world-class climate science platform" that offers information and analysis on climate change risks and impacts in Brazil, freely available online [6, 8-10]. It provides climate change impact risk data for various "strategic sectors" such as "water resources, food, and energy," covering "all regions, states, and municipalities of Brazil" [10-12].

Despite AdaptaBrasil's crucial role in translating scientific concepts into a navigable climate risk map, Painel do Clima acknowledges that this valuable information often remains "Far from the desks of decision-makers," "Far from the headlines of local newsrooms," and "Far from the daily lives of citizens" [4, 6]. Therefore, the synergistic goal of Painel do Clima is to leverage AdaptaBrasil's rich dataset to make climate risk information truly actionable and comprehensible at the local level. This involves translating complex scientific concepts into compelling narratives that drive public engagement and policy change [6].

## 4. Broader Strategy and Features

Beyond its core digital product, Painel do Clima employs a broader strategy that includes:

*   **Content Library:** A curated collection of resources by specialized journalists, offering courses and webinars [7, 13].
*   **AI-powered Interaction:** Features like "Chat with ClimateCuritiba AI" provide "real-time responses," "science-based" information, and "practical action tips" [7, 13].
*   **Audio Bulletins:** Designed for radio broadcast, these bulletins aim to reach communities across Brazil with accessible climate updates [7, 13].
*   **Training Courses:** Specific courses "for Journalists & Public Servants" are offered to enhance climate communication capacity [7, 13].
*   **Climate Tools:** Interactive resources developed "for Public Engagement" [7, 13].

## 5. Partnerships and Scalability

The initiative benefits from strong connections within the AdaptaBrasil network, including technical support from their team and visibility through official communication channels of the MCTI (Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation) and Ministry of Environment (MMA) [7, 14]. Painel do Clima is designed for adaptability across all 5,568 Brazilian municipalities, ensuring climate communication is "local, relevant, and continuous" [3, 4]. Campo Largo (PR) is a confirmed pilot partner, with plans to feature the panel on both city hall and city council websites [7, 14]. A Economia B will serve as an initial testing ground for newsrooms [14].

## 6. AdaptaBrasil Platform Technical Details

As the primary data source for Painel do Clima, understanding the technical aspects of AdaptaBrasil is crucial for LLM agents involved in the data pipeline. AdaptaBrasil provides indices and indicators of climate change impacts across various strategic sectors in Brazil. The platform offers data at both national and municipal levels, covering all 5,568 municipalities.

### 6.1. Data Categories and Indicators

The platform categorizes data into several strategic sectors, including:

*   **Recursos Hídricos (Water Resources)**
*   **Segurança Alimentar (Food Security)**
*   **Segurança Energética (Energy Security)**
*   **Infraestrutura Portuária (Port Infrastructure)**
*   **Saúde (Health)**
*   **Desastres Hidrológicos (Hydrological Disasters)**
*   **Infraestrutura Ferroviária (Railway Infrastructure)**
*   **Infraestrutura Rodoviária (Road Infrastructure)**

Within these sectors, AdaptaBrasil provides numerous indicators, each with specific IDs, names, and detailed descriptions. These indicators represent various climate risks and impacts, and their values are available for different years and scenarios.

### 6.2. API Access and Data Retrieval

AdaptaBrasil offers a programmatic API for data access, which is essential for Painel do Clima's data integration. The `AdaptaBrasilAPIAccess` GitHub repository provides Python scripts and comprehensive documentation to facilitate this process. Key aspects of the API and data retrieval include:
