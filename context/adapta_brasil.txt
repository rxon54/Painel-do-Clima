AdaptaBrasil: Climate Risk Assessment and Adaptation in Brazil
Briefing: AdaptaBrasil Platform for Climate Change Risk Assessment
This briefing summarises the key features, functionalities, and underlying conceptual framework of the AdaptaBrasil platform, a tool designed by the MCTI (Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation) to provide information and analysis on climate change risks and impacts in Brazil.
1. Purpose and Accessibility
The AdaptaBrasil platform is a free, online system developed to ensure accessibility of climate change impact risk information to a wide range of users. These include "decision-makers at all levels, as well as researchers, civil society, and the private sector." The platform aims to facilitate easy access to "the most relevant information for you or your organisation."
2. Understanding Climate Change Impact Risk
The platform's core concept, "climate change impact risk," is defined in accordance with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The IPCC states that this risk is "associated with the potential adverse consequences of climate change in a given environment," encompassing "lives, health, ecosystems, economic, social and cultural assets, and infrastructure."
According to the IPCC framework adopted by AdaptaBrasil, risk is composed of three key dimensions:
•
Climate Threat (Ameaça Climática): This refers to "changes in climatic parameters such as annual precipitation or average temperatures, as well as the intensification of extreme events such as prolonged droughts, heavy rains, or heatwaves."
•
Vulnerability (Vulnerabilidade): This dimension addresses "how susceptible the system under analysis is to certain effects of the climate threat." It is further broken down into:
◦
Sensitivity (Sensibilidade): "the degree to which the system is affected by stimuli related to the topic."
◦
Adaptive Capacity (Capacidade Adaptativa): "the system's ability to adjust."
◦
For example, a municipality with limited water supply alternatives is "more vulnerable to a climate threat of drought."
•
Exposure (Exposição): This signifies "the presence of people, livelihoods, species or ecosystems, environmental functions, services and resources, and infrastructure or economic, social or cultural goods in places that may be adversely affected." An example given is a population residing in an area prone to flooding being "more exposed to a climate threat related to excessive rain."
The "union of these three dimensions generates the climate change impact risk index" displayed on the platform.
3. Hierarchical Structure of Indices and Indicators
The AdaptaBrasil platform organises its data using a hierarchical structure, conceptualised as a multi-level "tree" based on the IPCC's framework. This structure allows users to explore the composition of the risk indices in detail:
•
Level 1 (Highest): Represents the "strategic sector" itself, without associated data.
•
Level 2: The "climate change impact risk index" for a given strategic sector. This is the most aggregated value.
•
Level 3: Composed of the three core dimensions: "vulnerability, exposure, and climate threat" indices.
•
Level 4: Within the vulnerability index, this level includes "sensitivity and adaptive capacity" indices.
•
Levels 5 and 6 (Lowest): These are "specific to each strategic sector" and are called "indicators."
◦
Level 5: "Thematic indicators," which combine different "simple indicators."
◦
Level 6: "Simple indicators," also known as "influencing factors." These are crucial as they represent the specific factors "on which public and private managers can elaborate strategic actions."
The composition of these levels can vary across sectors. For instance, in "energy security, Level 5 is not considered as there are no thematic indicators," meaning "the simple indicators for this security directly compose the sensitivity, adaptive capacity, exposure, or climate threat indices." Detailed descriptions of each indicator, its level, climate threat, and strategic sector are available on the "about" page under "indices and indicators."
4. Strategic Sectors and Data Visualisation
The platform provides risk impact data for various "strategic sectors," including "water resources, food, and energy." Users can access diverse indices for "all regions, states, and municipalities of Brazil."
Key navigation and visualisation features include:
•
Accessing the Platform: Users can click on "access the platform" or select one of the "strategic sectors presented on the home page."
•
Territorial Resolution: Data can be viewed at different territorial scales, such as "geopolitical region" (e.g., Northeast) or "municipality."
•
Navigating Levels: Users can "descend" to explore the influence of factors used in an index or "ascend" to see the aggregation of these factors.
•
Detailed Municipality Information: Clicking on a municipality (e.g., Petrolina) displays "all indices/indicators that influence the risk of drought impact related to energy security in this municipality" in descending order of influence.
•
Contextual Layers: Users can "include visualisation layers such as hydrography, relief, or road network of the region" by clicking "options."
•
Future Projections: The platform allows consultation of "risk science projections for the years 2030 and 2050, considering pessimistic or optimistic scenarios."
•
Data Presentation: Data can be viewed as "maps" or "graphs that summarise the results and compare scenarios."
•
Sharing and Download: Information can be shared by "copying the URL" to generate a direct link or "downloaded using different formats" for use in other applications.
5. Interpreting Results and Actionable Insights
The platform is designed to help users interpret results and identify areas for intervention.
•
Glossary and Explanations: The "glossary" helps understand key concepts, and the "indices and indicators" section provides explanations for each available index and indicator per strategic sector.
•
Understanding Composition: Users can "descend or ascend the hierarchical levels to understand the composition of the observed results."
•
Identifying Influencing Factors: When a municipality is selected, the platform provides a detailed list of "factors that influence the obtained result" for a specific index or indicator. These factors are ordered "according to their degree of influence... from highest to lowest."
•
Actionable Data: Critically, "it is precisely on these factors that managers can focus to analyse and suggest possible adaptation actions or measures to improve the risk impact index of the municipalities."
