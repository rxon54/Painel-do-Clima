# Project Requirements: Painel do Clima

## Overview
Painel do Clima is a Python-based tool that retrieves, processes, and summarizes climate risk data for Brazilian municipalities using the AdaptaBrasil API. The goal is to make complex climate risk information accessible and actionable for local decision-makers, journalists, and citizens.

## Objectives
- Fetch climate risk data for a specified municipality from the AdaptaBrasil API.
- Summarize and present the results in clear, actionable language.
- Support data filtering by city, year, scenario, and indicator.
- Output results in formats suitable for dashboards, newsrooms, and public communication.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. API Integration
- Connect to AdaptaBrasil API endpoints (e.g., `/api/info/BR/municipio/{region_id}/{city_id}/{year}/{scenario}`).
- Allow dynamic selection of municipality, year, and scenario.

### 2. Data Processing
- Parse and structure the API response.
- Extract key indices and indicators (risk, vulnerability, exposure, climate threat, etc.).
- Rank influencing factors by degree of impact.

### 3. Summarization
- Generate human-readable summaries of climate risks and adaptation opportunities for the selected city.
- Highlight actionable insights and most influential factors.

### 4. Output
- Present results as text summaries and structured data (JSON, CSV).
- Optionally, provide data for visualization (e.g., graphs, dashboards).

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Written in Python 3.x.
- Modular, well-documented code.
- Easy to extend for new indicators or output formats.
- Compliant with open data and accessibility standards.

## Stretch Goals
- Support batch processing for multiple cities.
- Integrate with visualization libraries (e.g., matplotlib, plotly).
- Provide a simple web interface or API for external access.
